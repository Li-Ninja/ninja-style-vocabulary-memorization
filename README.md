# Ninja-style Vocabulary Memorization

The genesis of this project was to address the issue of easily forgetting Japanese vocabulary.

During the planning stages of my self-guided trip to Japan, I experimented with various applications and web pages on the market that offered similar functionalities. However, I often found that while they met some specific requirements (Function A), they lacked others (Function B) or the integration was not up to my expectations, resulting in a less than satisfactory user experience.

To rectify this problem, I developed a new web application. In accordance with Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve, short-term memory experiences a 56% rate of forgetting just an hour later. Through my application, users can receive notifications just as a word is on the brink of being forgotten, thereby reinforcing the retention of memory and facilitating its transition into long-term memory.
